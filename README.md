# hello-world
My first repository to learn GitHub basics.


This is my first time editing a page on GitHub.  I am an oboist, who has been performing professionaly for over 10 years in Chicago.  I am learning Coding to help make technology that is useful for musicians.  

Now I am on my second edit.  I changed "Software Engineering" to "Coding" in the paragraph above.  Can you find the spot?  I also deleted "I also love coding!".
