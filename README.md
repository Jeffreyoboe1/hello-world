# hello-world
My first repository to learn GitHub basics.


This is my first time editing a page on GitHub.  I am an oboist, who has been performing professionaly for over 10 years in Chicago.  I am learning Software Engineering to help make technology that is useful for musicians.  I also just love coding.
